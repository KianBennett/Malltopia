A customer enters the mall with a random level of happiness, energy and budget
They also have a certain product they want and will make their way to that store
When they buy that product they will wander for a bit. If their happiness and budget are high enough 
    and they see a shop they will enter it and buy a product
    
Budget:
    When a customer spends money their budget goes down, if this reaches 0 they leave the mall x

Energy:
    Energy starts at max value and steadily decreases over time x
    Sitting on benches or eating food replenishes energy
    Customers can sit down/eat during their wander state and are more likely to if they have low energy
    If a customer's energy reaches 0 they will leave the mall

Happiness:
    When they buy a product, their happiness increases
    Waiting in a queue for too long steadily decreases their happiness
    Seeing rubbish on the floor will decrease happiness
        This goes on a cooldown - other bits of rubbish cannot decrease happiness for X seconds
        There is an even longer cooldown for seeing the same bit of rubbish
    Seeing decorations and entertainers increases happiness

Wandering:
    When the customer has purchased what the came for they will wander about the mall
    Mostly this is walking about randomly but also going up to shop windows, looking at entertainers etc
    If they see a shop window and have enough budget, they have a random chance to go look at it
    If they see a food cart and have a low enough energy, they will have a random chance to buy it
    If they see a bench and have a low enough energy, they will have a random chance to go sit down for a bit

Interest:
    For each type of shop, a customer has an interest level
    If they are going to the mall specifically for this product, they will have a max interest value
    Otherwise they have a low but random interest in it 
        For example if the weather is cold, people's interest in coat shops will be slightly higher
    Looking through the windows of the shop will increase their interest level, especially if there are window displays
    Seeing adverts and impressive shop signs will also increase their interest
    If their interest is high enough they will enter the shop and look at the merchandise, further increasing their interest
    When their interest reaches max value, they will purchase the product
